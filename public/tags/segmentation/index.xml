&lt;a href=&#34;https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Kirillov_Segment_Anything_ICCV_2023_paper.html&#34;&gt;Segment Anything (SAM)&lt;/a&gt; has drawn massive attention in the computer vision community, accumulating an impressive 8,000 citations. Segmentation has long been a crucial yet challenging aspect of computer vision. One of the biggest hurdles? Annotation. Unlike simple bounding boxes, which only require marking the object’s general location, segmentation demands precise pixel-level annotations—an incredibly tedious and time-consuming task for annotators. SAM is one of the first large-scale foundation models for segmentation. What makes SAM truly great is that it’s a promptable model. This means you can use it for various tasks without the need for fine-tuning—also known as zero-shot learning. Unlike LLM, here the prompts for the SAM are points, bounding boxes, and masks. In October 2022, Meta&amp;rsquo;s research team released &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00714&#34;&gt;SAM2&lt;/a&gt;, extending its capabilities from image segmentation to real-time video segmentation. Given my experience with SAM2, I think this is a game-changer in the object tracking domain, demonstrating long-term object tracking. In this post, we’re going to explore the key components of SAM and also dive into SAM2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
