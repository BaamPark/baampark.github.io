# The Power of Graph Representation Learning in Modern Computer Vision
![Alt text](/static/images/2024-07-25_GCN/cover.png)
Graph structures have been applied in many scientific fields, such as biology, computer science, and social network analysis. With the increasing popularity of machine learning, the graph representation learning (GRL) paradigm has emerged as effective methods. One example is the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which has shown remarkable success in tasks like node classification, graph generation and clustering by effectively capturing the complex relationships in graph data. GRL is also making big waves in modern computer vision. 

You might wonder how GRL can be used in modern computer vision. The potential of graphs isn't just about finding paths from point A to point B. For instance, you can restructure an image into a graph, transforming pixels into nodes and their relationships into edges. That's not it. You can even restructure a complex label for an image into a graph and use it for graph learning. In this article, we will talk about how graph representation learning can be used in modern computer vision. We will also cover a pratice of graph representation learning using Pytorch.
